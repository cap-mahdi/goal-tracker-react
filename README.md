## Goal Tracker

The goal tracker is a small React app designed to help you track your goals and visualize the progress you've made for each goal. With this app, you can effortlessly create new goals by providing a title and a set of steps. Additionally, you have the flexibility to update your goals by conveniently checking or unchecking the steps as you make progress. If needed, you can also remove goals that are no longer relevant. This project was made to practice more state management within a React application.
